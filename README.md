# decision_tree_adults
The aim of the project is to build and compare regression models based on decision trees. The Adult collection was used to create the models, which can be found at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/machine-learning-databases/adult/. The collection contains approx. 30 thousand. observations, given as a unique observation with frequency weights. The variables contain information about age, employment, education, marital status, occupation, role in the family, race, gender, country of origin, capital gains and losses, number of working hours per week, and the goal variable, i.e. the binary variable income, which informs whether a given person earns above or below 50,000 dollars a year. The frequency weights are illustrated by the variable fnlwgt.
